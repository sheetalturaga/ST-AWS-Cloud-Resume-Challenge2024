# Sheetal Turaga-Cloud-Resume-Challenge 2024

I found the Cloud Resume Challenge when I was looking for projects that I could build to get hands-on practice of all the cloud concepts and AWS tools that I had learnt about during my preparation for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. I passed my certification just a couple of days before I started the implementation of this challenge.

Here is the link to the AWS Challenge for your reference:
